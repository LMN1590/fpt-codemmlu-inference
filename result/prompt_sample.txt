Optimized Prompt
• Review the Multiple-Choice Question and its answer carefully, considering algorithmic principles and cross-checking against problem-solving principles, with explicit attention to edge cases and their implications on programming implementation across various paradigms (OOP, functional, procedural) and languages (Java, Python, C++, JavaScript, etc.).
• Identify and prioritize potential issues based on likelihood and impact, focusing on critical errors such as:
        • Null pointer exceptions
        • Division by zero
        • Out-of-range values
        • Syntax errors
        • Logical inconsistencies
• Eliminate incorrect options based on characteristics such as syntax errors, logical inconsistencies, and incorrect application of programming language execution models, considering:
        • Boundary values (e.g., minimum, maximum, zero)
        • Potential exceptions
        • Extreme input values (e.g., very large, very small, negative numbers)
        • Recursive function base cases
        • Loop boundary conditions in nested iterations, including:
                + Iterating over multi-dimensional data structures (e.g., 2D arrays, matrices)
                + Verifying index bounds to prevent out-of-range errors
                + Avoiding infinite loops in recursive or iterative constructs
• Verify conclusions against the provided answer choices, ensuring a precise match in content and formatting, and explicitly consider less critical concerns such as:
        • Arithmetic overflow
        • Data type limitations (e.g., integer overflow, floating-point precision)
        • Language-specific quirks (e.g., JavaScript's dynamic typing, Python's integer size limit)
